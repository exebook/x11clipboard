X11Clipboard minimal programs

This is a bare bones, minimal clipboard implementation for X11.

This will help you to enhance your plain X11 (Xlib) program with CLIPBOARD access.

Documentation for X11 clipboard is very obscure, and existing implementations are usually very hard to read.

These particular programs use only main CLIPBOARD object of X11, not a SELECTION not a CUT-BUFFER.

See the source luke.

PS: The main application is the interception of dynamic links in browsers.
